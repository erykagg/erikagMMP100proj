<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<h2>A Short Biography about myself:
		I always liked different art platforms and being able to see new things, I was originally a science major going into medical work since ive been exposed to it alot. Art, digital art, and animation has always appealed to me and to choose between science and art was hard, i tried to study in the medical field and also persue arts but it was extremely hard since i needed to put attention to my work, and i wasnt enjoying it. I soon changed my major to something i found intereted and was a bit related to art. I am still getting used to everything and altough it is fun it is also complicated since how things change fast and i need to adapt to certain ways while learning my new found passion. </h2>

		<h3> I am still try to work my hardest since i am really new to my new major which is Multi media.
A few things about me personally:

i try to improve myself but somethings im lazy. :)</h3>
